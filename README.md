# Magic Jars
## Game Principle

This project has been inspired by [Graven's Exercise](http://graven.yt/git/git.pdf).

The player begins with 3 lives, has 5 jars in front of him.
A jar contains either a magic key or a snake.
If the player chooses a jar containing a magic key, it is added to a bunch of keys.
If the player chooses a jar containing a snake, the player loses a life.
If the player has no more lives, the game is over.

## Parts and Rounds
The game is divided into 4 parts which have 3 rounds.
In the first round there is a snake among the 5 jars.
In the next round there is one more snake in one of the 5 jars.
