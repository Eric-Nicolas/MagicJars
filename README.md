# Magic Jars
## Game Principle

Before the launching of the game, the player can choose the level of 
difficulty. The player has 5 jars in front of him.
Some of them contain a magic key, and some of them contain a snake (according to
the difficulty).

Each time the player wins, a key is added in his bunch of keys, and the game is
relaunched.
If the player loses, a key is removed from his bunch of keys.
